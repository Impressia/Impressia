## Translations

Application is using new translation mechanism introduced in XCode 15 (xcstring). Here you can find description how this mechanism is working: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNbnwwLrJE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNbnwwLrJE8).

In the applications we have several string catalogs:
 - Localization/Localizable
 - EnvironmentKit/Source/EnvironmentKit/Localizable
 - WidgetKit/Source/WidgetKit/Localizable
 - ServicesKit/Source/ServicesKit/Localizable
 - PixelfedKit/Source/PixelfedKit/Localizable
 - ClientKit/Source/ClientKit/Localizable

Right now it's very easy to find new (not translated yet) titles. Also you can mark titles which need some review.
However you need to have XCode 15 installed. There isn't right now good external tool that have similar features.

From time to time you have to come back and translate lines which has been added since the last translation. 

## Technical debt

Things that should be implemented in version 2.0:

 - [ ] Use auto generated resources (Color/Images) instead static extensions (how to do this in separete Swift Packages?)
 - [x] Move to xcstring (new Xcode transaction system)
 - [x] Move to new Observable macro (iOS 17)
 - [x] Migrate to SwiftData (iOS 17)
 - [ ] Use ViewModels
 - [x] Add tips (new TipKit framework in iOS 17)
 - [ ] Enable swiftlint (https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5053)
